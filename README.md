# Hi, I'm Ogaga

**Chemical Engineer turned AI/ML Engineer** | CS Grad Student @ UT Dallas

I build machine learning tools that solve real-world problems — from NLP sentiment classifiers to scientific computing pipelines. I care about making AI that's explainable, fair, and useful.

## What I'm Working On

- **Sentiment Analysis Tool** — Multi-domain text classifier trained on 238K+ reviews (91.4% accuracy)
- Building toward deep learning (DistilBERT), explainability (SHAP/LIME), and bias analysis

## Tech Stack

**AI/ML:** Python | scikit-learn | pandas | TF-IDF | Logistic Regression | NLP

**Scientific Computing:** MATLAB | Curve Fitting | Numerical Methods | Signal Processing

**Tools:** Git | Jupyter | matplotlib | seaborn | joblib
